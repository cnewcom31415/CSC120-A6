What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Unit testing is amaxing. It is so much easier to test for things in little chunks. One test can be used to make sure you're doing another test correctly. I do think I prefer it over main methods. 

In terms of what worked, going method by method. What didn't, keeping myself to a rigid view. I had to get creative with a few of these, and it took a bit to determine what was a bug and what was a feature in some cases (An object with a different pointer but same attributes won't show up as the same item, so you need to be careful of that when testing). My advice would be creative with this one, and for sure have tests that also work and assert true. I think I had 1.5 times the number of true tests as I did the bug tests, what is true can help you determine what might be buggy.
